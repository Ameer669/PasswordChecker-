- The Digital Shield: A Password Security Documentary

An immersive, interactive web documentary that transforms cybersecurity education through hands-on exploration of password security. This project bridges the gap between technical implementation and public understanding by converting a Python PasswordChecker class into an engaging multimedia experience.

-- What It Does
- **Analyzes password strength** in real-time using industry-standard criteria
- **Generates cryptographically secure passwords** with customizable parameters  
- **Educates users** about digital threats and defense mechanisms
- **Demonstrates code-to-web** translation of security algorithms
- **Provides interactive timeline** of password security evolution

-- Technical Foundation
Built upon a robust Python PasswordChecker algorithm that evaluates passwords using four critical criteria: digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. The web implementation maintains the same security principles while adding visual feedback and educational content.

-- Educational Impact
Transforms complex cybersecurity concepts into accessible, interactive lessons. Users can experiment with password combinations, receive immediate strength feedback, and understand the mathematical principles behind digital security.
